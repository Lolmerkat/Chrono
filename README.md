## Why Chrono

Chrono is a calendar focused on the ability to use it anywhere.
This is why it is developed with a Command Line Interface (`cli`)
and a Terminal User Interface (`tui`) in mind.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Implement basic functionality
- [ ] Implement a simple json-rpc backend
- [ ] Implement a native desktop application
    - Using: Kotlin/Multiplattform and JetBrains Compose

## Modules

- [chrono-core](https://github.com/Lolmerkat/chrono-core): Main backend, written in Kotlin.
- [chrono-cli](https://github.com/Lolmerkat/chrono-cli): CLI implementation, containing command control only.
- [chrono-docs](https://github.com/Lolmerkat/chrono-docs): Documentation including concepts and plans for Chrono. (Yes, this really is just an obsidian vault)

## Contribution

In the early stages of development I will _not_ review pull requests or issues. If you want to contribute anyways you can open an issue and if I have time and get around to do it I will check it out.
Feedback will still be apprechiated.
